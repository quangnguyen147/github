            Biryani
          </div>
          <p>
            Biryani, whilst not unique to Bangladesh, is a spicy rice dish made
            with meat or fish, rice, potatoes and spices. Hugely popular
            throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladeshi biryani is often
            considered the best in the world. In the Bengali region, popular
            meats include mutton, goat, chicken and beef, but there is such a
            wide variety of biryani dishes available that you can try. A true
            traditional biryani involves different types of cooking and
            preparation, as marinated meat is layered with rice, potatoes and
            spices, the dish is jam packed with flavour. You will often find
            biryani served at special occasions or celebrations such as
            weddings, but it is also eaten as a regular meal throughout the
            weak, such is its popularity.

            Changri malai curry
          </div>
          <p>
            Changri malai curry is the most famous Bangladesh curry dish based
            on coconut milk, and is revered throughout the region, including
            India. Chingri Malai (or Chingri Macher Malaikari as it is sometimes
            known), is a delicious creamy, satisfying seafood curry that is
            prepared by cooking prawns or shrimp in a coconut milk sauce with
            aromatic spices and served with basmati rice. Coconut milk is a very
            common ingredient in Bangladeshi cuisine, and this Changri Malai
            curry is a perfect example of that. The word Malai suggests the dish
            was actually brought to the region by Malaysian sailors docking at
            the Bay of Bengal many years ago, and the use of coconut in curries
            gives credence to this theory since it is popular in South-East
            Asian cuisine. Bangladeshi cooking is famed for its use of seafood
            and fish in curries, so Chingri malai is definitely a dish to try if
            you’re ever in the region.
